window-help-text1, Spyfall is a game where players are each assigned a role and a general location. One player is randomly selected and does not receive any information. This player is the Spy. The Spy's goal is to find out the location in which the game is currently taking place. At no point are normal players allowed to reveal their role or the location.
window-help-text2, Players take turns asking other players questions, attempting to find out who the spy is within a limited amount of time. Players can make a majority vote where they decide on a player to be the spy. If the given player is the spy after the vote successfully passes the spy loses and everyone else wins. If the selection is not the spy, the real spy wins the game. The spy can also win the game at any point by calling a timeout and attempting to state the location that the game is taking place in.
